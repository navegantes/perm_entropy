% IAAFT: Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform surrogates
% This function generates 'nsur' IAAFT-surrogate time series 
% and stores them in the matrix 'zM' (columnwise). These surrogates
% are supposed to have the same amplitude distribution (marginal cdf) 
% and autocorrelation as the given time series 'xV'. 
% The IAAFT algorithm is proposed in 
% Schreiber, T. and Schmitz, A. (1996) "Improved Surrogate Data for 
% Nonlinearity Tests", Physical Review Letters, Vol 77, 635-638.
% The IAAFT is an improvement of the AAFT. Iteratively, it fits the 
% amplitudes and at each step improves the spectral phases and then 
% reorders the derived time series at each step until convergence of 
% both spectral density and amplitude distribution is reached. 
% The algorithm terminates if complete convergence (same reordering in 
% two consecutive steps) is succeeded or if the 'maxi' number of 
% iterations is reached. 
% INPUT
% - xV  : the given time series
% - nsur: the number of surrogate time series (default is 1)
% OUTPUT
% - zM  : the n x nsur matrix of 'nsur' IAAFT surrogate time series
